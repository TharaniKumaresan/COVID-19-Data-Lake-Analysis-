# COVID-19-Data-Lake-Analysis-
• Used AWS to analyze COVID-19 World cases death dataset from an open data registry for AWS, forecasting the number of confirmed COVID cases, tests performed, and total number of deaths to take appropriate actions.
• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter notebook to detect outliers and to understand different patterns in the data through visualizations.
• Loaded the dataset into Amazon S3, created an amazon SageMaker instance.
• Completed Data Preparation using Jupyter notebook by cleaning and transforming the raw data prior to processing and analysis.
• Used Linear regression model for predicting total cases.
• Used Polynomial features to optimize the model for reducing the root mean squared error and have done visualizations by plotting polynomial regression best fit and train data for total cases for various dates.
